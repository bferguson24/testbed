This project was developed as part of my universities Senior Design project, where groups of students are assigned to a specific sponsor's project and given two semesters to design, assemble, and test their solution. 

NASA JPL tasked our group with developing a testbed and vibrating end effector aimed to minimize lunar excavation forces. The project aimed to provide meaningful modelling data about the dynamics of specified vibrational inputs, frequency responses, and measured excavation forces across a range of different testing conditions.
